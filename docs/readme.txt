SunVox Library allows you to use most of SunVox features in your own products:
 * load and play several SunVox/XM/MOD music files simultaneously;
 * play interactive/generative/microtonal music;
 * play synths, apply effects;
 * load samples (WAV,AIFF,XI), synths and effects created by other users;
 * change the project parameters (synth controllers, pattern notes, etc.).
